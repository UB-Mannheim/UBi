# Open Science at the University of Mannheim

Open Science at the University of Mannheim encompasses open access, open data, open software, and broader concepts such as Third Mission, Citizen Science, and Open Innovation. The university is committed to transparent and replicable research, promoting open science practices including pre-registration, open data, open materials, and open source.
